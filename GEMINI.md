# Project Context: AAC Music Library & Ripping Automation

## Overview
This directory (`/home/bobp/AAC`) serves as the central storage and processing hub for an automated CD ripping workflow. It contains the output audio library (organized by Artist/Album), temporary processing data for the `abcde` tool, and the primary automation script.

## Automation & Scripts

### `rip_robot.sh`
The core automation script that drives the ripping process.
*   **Purpose:** Manages concurrent ripping across multiple optical drives.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Spawns a background worker loop for each configured drive (`/dev/sr0` through `/dev/sr4`).
    2.  Polls for disc presence using `cd-discid`.
    3.  Upon detection, triggers `abcde` (A Better CD Encoder) with the `-N` (non-interactive) flag.
    4.  Logs the result (Success/Failure) to `$HOME/rip_log.txt`.
    5.  Ejects the disc and waits for the next insertion.
*   **Dependencies:** `abcde`, `cd-discid`, `eject`.

## Directory Structure

*   **Output Library:**
    *   Folders named `[Artist Name]/` containing subfolders for `[Album Title]/`.
    *   Contains the ripped audio files (M4A/AAC format).
*   **Working Directories:**
    *   `abcde.*/`: Temporary directories generated by `abcde` containing session data, CDDB/MusicBrainz queries, and processing status.
*   **Scripts:**
    *   `rip_robot.sh`: The main executable for the ripping engine.

## Usage

To start the automated ripping engine:
```bash
./rip_robot.sh
```
*   **Monitoring:** The script outputs real-time progress from `abcde` to the terminal.
*   **Logs:** A persistent history of events is written to `$HOME/rip_log.txt`.

## Configuration
*   **Drive Setup:** The specific drives to monitor are defined in the `DRIVES` array within `rip_robot.sh`.
*   **Output Paths:** The output location for music files is determined by the `abcde.conf` (system-wide or user-local), though the script runs within this directory, implying this is the destination.
